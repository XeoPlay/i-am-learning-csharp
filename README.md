# what is this
i'm uploading everything i learn about c-sharp, so i dont have to find the folder with all the
projects every time. i can just go here.

thats about it

i'm using visual studio 2019

ignore "tutorialtest" that was a mistake

there's some mistakes with the commits because visual studio had some temporary files that
i didn't notice.
