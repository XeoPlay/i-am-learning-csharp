# what is this
i'm uploading everything i learn about c-sharp, so i dont have to find the folder with all the
projects every time. i can just go here.

thats about it

i'm using visual studio 2019

there's some mistakes with the commits because visual studio had some temporary files that
i didn't notice.

the programs themselves are usually at [foldername]/[foldername]/Program.cs

if you want to open the project in visual studio you need [project_name].sln
(and the whole folder of the project obviously)
